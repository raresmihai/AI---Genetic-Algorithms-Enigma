 Probably I should have
told the whole story to the doctor, for I was in mortal fear
lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make
an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor father died
quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters
on one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the
neighbours, the arranging of the funeral, and all the work
of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so
busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain, far
less to be afraid of him.
He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had
his meals as usual, though he ate little and had more, I am
afraid, than his usual supply of rum, for he helped himself
out of the bar, scowling and blowing through his nose,
and no one dared to cross him. On the night before the
funeral he was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in
that house of mourning, to hear him singing away at his
ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was, we were all in the
fear of death for him, and the doctor was suddenly taken
up with a case many miles away and was never near the
house after my father’s death. I have said the captain was
weak, and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than
regain his strength. He clambered up and down stairs, and
went from the parlour to the bar and back again, and

sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea,
holding on to the walls as he went for support and
breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain.
He never particularly addressed me, and it is my belief he
had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper
was more flighty, and allowing for his bodily weakness,
more violent than ever. He had an alarming way now
when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it
bare before him on the table. But with all that, he minded
people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and
rather wandering. Once, for instance, to our extreme
wonder, he piped up to a different air, a king of country
love-song that he must have learned in his youth before he
had begun to follow the sea.
So things passed until, the day after the funeral, and
about three o’clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I
was standing at the door for a moment, full of sad
thoughts about my father, when I saw someone drawing
slowly near along the road. He was plainly blind, for he
tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green
shade over his eyes and nose; and he was hunched, as if
with age or weakness, and wore a huge old tattered seacloak
with a hood that made him appear positively
deformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking
