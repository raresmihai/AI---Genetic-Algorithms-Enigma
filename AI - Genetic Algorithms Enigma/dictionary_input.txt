FROM the side of the hill, which was here steep and
stony, a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling
and bounding through the trees. My eyes turned
instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap with
great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was,
whether bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It
seemed dark and shaggy; more I knew not. But the terror
of this new apparition brought me to a stand.
I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind
me the murderers, before me this lurking nondescript.
And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I
knew to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared less
terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I
turned on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over
my shoulder, began to retrace my steps in the direction of
the boats.
Instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide
circuit, began to head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but
had I been as fresh as when I rose, I could see it was in

vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary.
From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer,
running manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I
had ever seen, stooping almost double as it ran. Yet a man
it was, I could no longer be in doubt about that.
I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was
within an ace of calling for help. But the mere fact that he
was a man, however wild, had somewhat reassured me,
and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion. I
stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of
escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my
pistol flashed into my mind. As soon as I remembered I
was not defenceless, courage glowed again in my heart
and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and
walked briskly towards him.
He was concealed by this time behind another tree
trunk; but he must have been watching me closely, for as
soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared
and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated, drew back,
came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and
confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his
clasped hands in supplication.
At that I once more stopped.
‘Who are you?’ I asked.

‘Ben Gunn,’ he answered, and his voice sounded
hoarse and awkward, like a rusty lock. ‘I’m poor Ben
Gunn, I am; and I haven’t spoke with a Christian these
three years.’
I could now see that he was a white man like myself
and that his features were even pleasing. His skin,
wherever it was exposed, was burnt by the sun; even his
lips were black, and his fair eyes looked quite startling in
so dark a face. Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or
fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was clothed
with tatters of old ship’s canvas and old sea-cloth, and
this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a
system of the most various and incongruous fastenings,
brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin.
About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt,
which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement.
‘Three years!’ I cried. ‘Were you shipwrecked?’
‘Nay, mate,’ said he; ‘marooned.’
I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible
kind of punishment common enough among the
buccaneers, in which the offender is put ashore with a
little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate
and distant island
