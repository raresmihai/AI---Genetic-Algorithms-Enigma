And  he  threw  down three or four gold pieces on the threshold. ‘You can tell  me  when  I’ve  worked  through  that,’  says  he,  looking  as fierce as a commander. And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed
Treasure Island 7 of 330 before  the  mast,  but  seemed  like  a  mate  or  skipper  accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came with  the  barrow  told  us  the  mail  had  set  him  down  the  morning before at the Royal George, that he had inquired what  inns  there  were  along  the  coast,  and  hearing  ours  well  spoken  of,  I  suppose,  and  described  as  lonely,  had  chosen  it  from  the  others  for  his  place  of  residence.
